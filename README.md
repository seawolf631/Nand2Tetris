# Nand2Tetris
Building a modern computer from scratch, one layer in the stack at a time

projects/01 = Logic Gates - Built Not, And, Or/Xor, Multiplexor/Demultiplexor, Multi-Bit Not/And/Or, and Multi-Bit Multiplexor, using a Hardware Design Language (HDL) and a NAND gate that are given

projects/02 = Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) - Built Half-Adder, Full-Adder, Adder, Incrementer, and a 16 bit ALU, using the same HDL language and the logic gates created in the previous project

projects/03 = Memory - Built Flip-Flop, 1-Bit Register (Bit), 8-Register Memory (RAM8), n-Register Memory, and Counter using HDL and the gates from previous projects

projects/04 = Machine Language - Wrote a program that muliplies 2 inputs, and a program that runs an infinite loop and turns the screen black when input on the keyboard is pressed. Both programs used a slim assembly language called "Hack"

projects/05 = Computer Architecture - Built 16-Bit CPU, 16-Bit Read-Only 32K Memory, Screen Interface, Keyboard Interface, Memory (RAM, Keyboard, and Screen memory maps), and Computer (CPU, RAM, ROM, keyboard, and screen) using the HDL language and previously made chips

projects/06 = Assembler - Built assembler using the Java programming language to translate Hack assembly language into binary code. Tested assembler using supplied assembler and the test scripts provided, which included a script for the game of Pong

projects/07 = Virtual Machine Part 1: Stack Arithmetic - Built first version of Virtual Machine for "Jack" programming language to the "Hack" assembly language. This version implements 9 stack arithmetic and logical commands, as well as the push constant command. This version of the Virtual Machine was tested using the given virtual machine emulator and test programs for the stack arithmetic and memory access

projects/08 = Virtual Machine Part 2: Program Control - Built final version of Virutal Machine that can now handle program flow and function calling commands. Tested with virtual machine emulator and test scripts for program flow commands and function calling commands

projects/09 = High Level Language - Built a basic application using the "Jack" programming language in order to get acquainted with the language before building the compiler. The "Jack" language is a more stripped down version of the Java programming languaage
