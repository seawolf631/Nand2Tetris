# Nand2Tetris
Building a modern computer from scratch, one layer in the stack at a time

projects/01 = Logic Gates - Built Not, And, Or/Xor, Multiplexor/Demultiplexor, Multi-Bit Not/And/Or, and Multi-Bit Multiplexor, using a Hardware Design Language (HDL) and a NAND gate that are given

projects/02 = Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) - Built Half-Adder, Full-Adder, Adder, Incrementer, and a 16 bit ALU, using the same HDL language and the logic gates created in the previous project
